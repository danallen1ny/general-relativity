this is MAPLE code. i add a bulk viscosity term to the pressure of the diagonalized Energy Momentum Tensor. The viscous pressure has the form p(t) - 3*nu*H(t) where nu, the bulk viscosity, is a positive constant.

The MAPLE code derives the first and second Friedmann equeations for the viscous model.

The first equation is the same as for the standard model (thus expansion parameter unchanged).

The second equation includes a positive term 12*pi*nu*H(t). This increases the magnitude of the deceleration parameter and corresponds to a slower expansion, which addreses the "Flatness" problem of the Standard Cosmology
